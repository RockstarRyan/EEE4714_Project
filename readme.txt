EEE 4714 Final Project
Group 11


Quick Start / Notes

First of all: apologies for getting this done so late. In any
case, this is the repository I created for our final project.
While it's a bit messy, all the work here is based on the
resources linked from the project description, primarily this:
https://dpacontest.telecom-paris.fr/v2/download.php. Some key
files and folders are listed below:

Development:
- /DPA_contest2_public_base_diff_vcc_a128_2009_12_23: raw
power trace data. This is a 12 GB dataset, so it has been
gitignored; if any of you wish to run tests yourself, you'd
have to follow the instructions on the link above to download
it.
- /attack_wrapper_1.1.1/run_test.sh: a script I wrote to
automate running the attacks using the provided dataset and
reference attack. This will not work as-is without the dataset
downloaded, but is how I generated all the test results
mentioned below.

Analysis:
- /attack_wrapper_1.1.1/src/results_testX: results for test
number X that were generated by running attack_wrapper with the
reference attack. I ran five tests, each considering a certain
number of keys each with a certain number of traces, and would
be more than happy to run more. Interpretation of these results
will be needed in the report.
- /attack_wrapper_1.1.1/src/reference_attack/attack_last_round
.cpp: the reference attack used to generate these results.
This attack targets the last round in AES, predicting the most
likely byte using inverse ShiftRows and taking advantage of
no MixColumns step. Again, more interpretation may be needed
here.
- /attack_wrapper_1.1.1/src/compute_results.c: the provided
script that converts the attack results into readable .dat
files. Look here for more context on how the .dat files are
generated.
